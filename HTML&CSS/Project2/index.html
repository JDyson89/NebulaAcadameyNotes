                        <p>Kobe 'Bean' Bryant was born August 23, 1978 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Bryant’s father, Joe (“Jelly Bean”) Bryant, was a professional basketball player who spent eight seasons in the NBA and eight more playing in Italy, where Bryant went to school. When his family returned to the United States, Bryant played basketball at Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, where he received several national Player of the Year awards and broke the southeastern Pennsylvania scoring record set by Wilt Chamberlain with 2,883 points.</p>

                    <p>Bryant opted to forgo college and declared himself eligible for the NBA draft when he graduated from high school. The Charlotte Hornets chose him with the 13th pick of the 1996 draft. He was traded to the Lakers shortly thereafter and became the second youngest NBA player in history when the 1996–97 season opened. He quickly proved his merit with the Lakers and was selected for the NBA All-Star Game in just his second season, becoming the youngest All-Star. The Lakers had won three consecutive NBA championships ending with five lead by Kobe.</p>

                    <p>After Bryant's retirement, he wrote books and won an Academy Award for an animated short film he had written. He coached his daughter’s travel basketball team. There was talk that he worked out with a few NBA players behind the scenes in the offseason. Bryant rarely watched NBA games after he retired. He only did so if a player asked him to review film. Otherwise, he spent most of his time on his projects or with his family.</p>
